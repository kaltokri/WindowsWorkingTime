WindowsWorkingTime is a small Java application which executes LogParser to export Event log entries into a CSV file,
read it and summize the time the computer was powered on.

I use this small code example to fresh up my Java programming knowledge and to show Java to my son.

It is not intended for productive use and it is far from perfect.
